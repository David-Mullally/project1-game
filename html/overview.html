    <p>C.A.R.D.S is my own take on 'Triple Triad', a card game that was first introduced in the RPG 'Final Fantasy VIII'. <br>
    Designed by battle system planner Takayoshi Nakazato Triple Triad is a sidequest which involves challenging various NPCs to win cards from them.
    These cards can eventually br refined into items that can be used in the main game... eg. rare items or weapons etc.
    Depending on the current trade rule, the player can win cards off their opponents in Triple Triad games
    and there are side quests that yield cards as rewards.

        Personally I enjoyed this way more than playing the main game itself. For that reason, I have decided to make my own version of it for my first project. 
    </p>
        <p class="text-aside"> I hope you have as much fun playing it as I did making it. Enjoy!!</p>
